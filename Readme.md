# ðŸŒŠ Urban Pluvial Flood Risk: A Data-Driven Analysis

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project analyzes urban pluvial flood risk using geospatial, environmental, and infrastructure data.  
The goal is to uncover key risk factors and build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to help city planners and stakeholders make informed decisions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Analyze Key Factors** â€“ Perform EDA on the flood risk dataset.  
2. **Uncover Insights** â€“ Identify patterns in land use, drainage density, and rainfall.  
3. **Visualize the Risk** â€“ Create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
**Source:** `urban_pluvial_flood_risk_dataset.csv`  
**Key Features:**  
- Geospatial: Latitude, Longitude, Elevation (m)  
- Infrastructure: Land Use, Drainage Density (km/kmÂ²), Storm Drain Type  
- Environmental: Soil Group, DEM Source  
- Meteorological: Historical Rainfall Intensity (mm/hr), Return Period (Years)  
- Target: Risk Labels (`ponding_hotspot`, `monitor`, etc.)  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Residential areas dominate** â†’ most vulnerable zones.  
- **Low drainage density strongly correlates** with high flood risk.  
- **Critical risk hotspots** often combine low elevation, sparse drainage, and extreme rainfall history.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Map** â†’ Visualize hotspots by city/ward.  
- **Dynamic Filters** â†’ Explore by land use, drainage type, risk level.  
- **KPIs & Charts** â†’ Average rainfall, high-risk segments, land-use breakdown.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Impact
- **Urban Planning:** Prioritize drainage upgrades.  
- **Preparedness:** Guide emergency resource allocation.  
- **Policy:** Evidence-based foundation for resilience planning.
